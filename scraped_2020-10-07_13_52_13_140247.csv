Jim,4.0,"We've taken our little guy to Chuck E. Cheese in other cities, but never in our home town.  We didn't let him know we had one.  However, today we decided to spill the beans & take him there for lunch.

Monday around 2:00pm.  There was only a couple people there.  The young man that greeted us & checked us in was very pleasant.  Ordered & grabbed a table.  Very clean facility.  That is a huge plus!  Lots of games & all of them are only 1 token.  No play equipment.  Not necessarily a bad thing.  Easier to keep eyes on your kiddos.  Pizza was meh.  Which is an improvement from days past.  Lots of soda to choose from.  Decent salad bar.  Plenty of prizes & candy to buy with your tickets.

Overall this was a great afternoon.  We will be back often.  Well done Mr. Cheese, well done indeed!  3.6 Star review",a year ago,Open,4066564171.0
Theodore Klotter,5.0,"It was very clean and had several different menu options. The staff were receptive and helpful. One thing I really liked is that every game only required one token. It was not like a usual arcade where some games require two or more to play. It had been many years since I had been to a Chucky Cheese. This was the first time I've been at the one in Billings and I will definitely go back. The pizza was really good! It was not the greasy, cheesy, gelatinous pepperoni  blob I remember growing up.

Chuck Burchell,1.0,"Horrible Service & Made My Son's Birthday Party So Much Harder. Our party host only checked on us twice. Had 20 kids waiting on pizza. They literally brought out one pizza at a time. The pizza for the adults came out 30 mins later. By that time we were done with cake. Everything was late including Chuck E Cheese. Would not let my 5 year old pick up any tickets from the ticket blaster. He was 5 and couldn't catch any of them. He got 3. Yes, only 3 tickets on his birthday. After all that our party host had the audacity to ask for a tip. Other parents helped clean up plates, cups and wrapping paper. Then they hurried us out the door because ""our time was up"". Even though they were the ones running 35 mins behind. Oh, ya and it cost over $700.00 for 5 pizzas and tokens for the kids. Would have been easier and less expensive to do it at home. Good thing my son didn't catch on. Other parents were dumbfounded by the lack of service and probably will be finding other places to have their party.",7 months ago,Open,4066564171.0
Johnny Earley,4.0,"Chuck e cheese is a hard place to quantify. The quality of the experience us very homogenized based on the national standards. The key differences come from staffing and store up keep. The billings location is typically very clean with a high degree of game maintenance with only an occasional dud every once and a while. Staff is typically above average with a reasonable amount of engagement and strict adherence to the child monitoring gateway.  Not a bad place, that can be pretty fun especially for kids in the 5-7 range.",a year ago,Open,4066564171.0

my 4 yr old & 3 yr old loved the rides..
I'll break it down as best I can for those who have questions like I did.
My only complaint is the price for pizza. Its $16 per large cheese only to add pepperoni was an additional $3 drinks are expensive too so your left with having to order the packages..The only 2 pizza package they have comes with 4 very small drinks &100 coins.. That cost $69.00 ALONE!!! We used the 100 then had to pay 20c per coin after so I got 80 coins for $20 the bummer is you cannot get ANYTHING cool for under 2000 coins which is nearly impossible.
They have a $10 round cake and a $20 square cake that come in chocolate or vanilla so that's cool & they have a couple of different designs they can add to the top for boys and girls,but when they brought it out it was still frozen in spots and incredibly hard to cut without tearing off the frozen frosting..it was hard and not that pleasant. I would definitely suggest buying your own cake or making your own
They bring out a bucket full of small paper plates and medium plates A pair of Gloves ( for cake cutting ) plastic silverware,candles and matches.
The pizza was pretty good but the cake was very unpleasant,the kids who eat literally anything couldn't even eat it so that speaks volumes.
Over all I spent about $125 and $95 of that was the cake,2 pizzas & 4 drinks - there was 7 of us if that helps.. Again the little kids LOVED the games most of which are for ages 2 and up,and they liked the atmosphere.
We had a good time so long as I kept buying  coins ü§£üëç",a year ago,Open,4066564171.0
