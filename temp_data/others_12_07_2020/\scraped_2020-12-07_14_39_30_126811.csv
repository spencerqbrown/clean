Saeed Ghadessi,4.0,Fantastic Pizza and Salads.... I am a huge fan of their cauliflower crust which I washing tastes better than the traditional crust.  There is plenty of free parking in the third street mall.  Can get a bit crowded on Wednesday and Saturday when Santa Monica Farmers Market is in the neighboring streets.  $$,a year ago,Open,2000041205
