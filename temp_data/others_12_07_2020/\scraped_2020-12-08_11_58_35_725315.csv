Thu Tran,5.0,I’m usually not a big deep dish guy. But I really liked Rosati’s. We got the 10 inch pizza and it was enough for 3 of us. Good sauce. Highly recommend.,a week ago,Open,2000743352
Kathy Beni,4.0,"Pleasantly surprised.  Tiny place with limited seat even if wasn't COVID-19.
Got thin crust, hamburger, mushrooms and onions, and 2 sodas <$25.  It took about 14 minutes, came with red pepper, parmesan cheese and salt packets if you wanted.  Good flavor on sauce, plenty of cheese.  Will try deep dish next time.",3 months ago,Open,2000743352
Gregory Packnett,5.0,As a native Chicagoan what I used to miss most was a good Italian beef sandwich. That is before Rosati’s opened. Great sandwich fixed the same way it was in Chicago.

Jon Struve,4.0,"We really enjoyed the pizza. Got the double dough pepperoni. We are new to town, wanted to try something local. Our only trouble with it was that it is extremely filling.
