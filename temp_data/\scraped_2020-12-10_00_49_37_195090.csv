Kortnay Brown,1.0,If I could give a negative star I would. Laziest. Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Not a single employee out front. But I've watched 8 employees walk out from the back of the restaurant. And now that I want my money back the register won't open. How convenient.,10 months ago,Closed,2000303519
Yessy Gal,1.0,The worst customer service everyone seems to have a stick up their behinds. Overpriced for cold pizza and when you ask them to warm them up they put them in the microwave.

Ronae Matriano,1.0,Worst $10 ever spent in my life. They microwave everything and itâ€™s all bland and old.
