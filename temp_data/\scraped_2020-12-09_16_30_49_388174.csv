Laurie Johnson,1.0,We had a HORRIBLE experience. We waited 2 and a half hours for take out when they told us 1 hour.  We cancelled our order and when the driver showed up I told him we had cancelled our order.  The next morning we wake up to this in the road right in front of our house.  HORRIBLE..SO DISAPPOINTING.,9 months ago,Open,2000776115

Daniela Hart,2.0,"To many fails. The wait is outrageous, gawd forbid any more people move here or youâ€™ll be waiting 2 hours or more. Orders arenâ€™t made right, pizza arrived completely ruined (like dropped). Then we call to give it one last try and after â€¦More",11 months ago,Open,2000776115

jerry townsend,4.0,"The food was great, and so are their salads but when you pay $ 7 for a salad and they tell you, you can't go back for another serving if you want. I bought three pizzas for our crown I don't care for pizza that's why I get a salad and a nice big salad is my dinner, so other than this little problem I think Mountain Mike's is okay.",a year ago,Open,2000776115
hortencia azevedo,2.0,First of all it was really cold in the sitting area. The pizza had to much sauce and could have been cooked longer. The dough was soggy. I am accustomed to gettimg a pizza that comes right out of the oven and being piping hot. This one not so much. Won't be back to this location. I recommend either Los Banos or Turlock mountain mikes.,a year ago,Open,2000776115
