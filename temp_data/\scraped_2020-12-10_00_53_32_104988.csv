amanda g,1.0,Went 30 minutes before closing and they were cleaning. I approached and she was trying to ignore and when I asked what is available she didn't want to answer. I think she was trying to take leftovers home. It looked freshly cook. I didn't want to mess up their dinner.,3 years ago,Closed,2000198842
