DeMorris Glasper,5.0,Godfather's Pizza is a dying breed however this location has held on in the test of time.  The pizza is cheesy and taste delicious.  I personally like the Golden crust which is nice rich buttery flavor to pair with any of specialty pizzas. ‚Ä¶More,a year ago,Closed,1000857463
Vick C,2.0,"Decent pizza buffet, but out of the 15 pizzas on the buffet 13 of them were cheese and sausage pizza. I asked for a supreme pizza and it was never made.
