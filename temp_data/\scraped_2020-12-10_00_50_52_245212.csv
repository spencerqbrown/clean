Diogo Botelho,2.0,Pizza is very good. The service is terrible. They serve pizza and I waited 20 minutes! They are making more pizza instead of attending customers. Last time they didn't even give me a tray.,3 years ago,Closed,2000198795

Isabel Clarke,1.0,"Stood at the register for 10 minutes, while a gentleman stood with his back to me cooking, waiting to order. No one came so I left. It's a shame Pizza looked good.",3 years ago,Closed,2000198795
