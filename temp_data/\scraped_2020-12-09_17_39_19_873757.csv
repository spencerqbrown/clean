Gabriel Estrada,3.0,"It‚Äôs an okay pizza place. It has the freshness but not the taste and the pizza is very dry. Not that much sauce on the pizza. Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, they do it make it on the spot and is fresh but the taste is just not their and that‚Äôs ‚Ä¶More",3 years ago,Closed,2000623568
Machelle Zehner,5.0,"We had a basic large pepperoni and cheese pizza, we ordered double pepperoni and they put on about 4 times more than we usually get else where . Great service and the pizza tasted awesome, and only $15. The only thing that would make it better would have a deck oven to cook it in, I'm not a fan of conveyor ovens.",9 months ago,Closed,2000623568

Kazia Hart,3.0,The pizza was good. There's something desolate about this whole plaza though. They don't have trash cans outside and when we went inside to throw away our Starbucks that we drank with our pizza they told us we can't throw away outside ‚Ä¶More,a year ago,Closed,2000623568
