Reid Adams,2.0,Waitress' were nice and service was good. Pizza was below average. Got 2 dollars worth of quarters for the arcade game which proceeded to eat all the money and not work. Instead of refunding us the 2 dollars the manager said they couldn't do anything about it. Now they lost a customer over it.,11 months ago,Open,2000671952
Jessica Abers,1.0,"The pizza tasted very old, it almost tasted sour. The only time their pizza tasted gross I mean it was awful I couldn’t even finish my slice. I was very disappointed considering how much I thought I loved Pizza Schmizza :(",8 months ago,Open,2000671952
summer pilcher,1.0,Tried calling 4x at 6:30pm to order a pizza and it went straight to voicemail. My husband went in at 6:40pm to order pizza in person and she said they couldn’t make a new pizza when they don’t close until 7pm? When my husband asked what was left she said a couple pizzas but she had planned on taking them home. This place is a joke.,7 months ago,Open,2000671952

Carpet Geeks Scheduling Team,4.0,"Pizza by the slice is awesome! Buy a whole pizza and it isn't the same. When I do get a whole one I re-heat on high heat before eating. They do this to their slices and it makes the crust crispy, otherwise it can be too flimsy.",a year ago,Open,2000671952
