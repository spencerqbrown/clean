Rico Richie,5.0,Best salads and the Mozzarella Pizza pies?? mmmmmgood,a month ago,Open,2000611550
Brandon Beevers,4.0,Pizza is great. Reason for the 4 stars? Their wings could use some help. They taste like chicken nugges from burger king with a little sauce on top. I think Howies needs to go where pizza hut goes for their wings and sauce. I order wings from the hut and pizza from howies for a good meal. And the soda is over priced.,5 months ago,Open,2000611550
Racso G,3.0,"Pizza is really good. One of my favorites. Glad they are in the neighborhood. But you cannot call this buffalo chicken wings. Look at them. They look like somebody put some buffalo sauce on kids chicken wings. There's sauce on top only, barely on the sides, and nothing at the bottom.",3 years ago,Open,2000611550
