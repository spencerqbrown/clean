Joshua LaMoria,1.0,"TERRIBLE!
I ordered a pepperoni pizza, howie rolls, cinna bread and a howie bread. The pepperoni pizza was chewy and the crust was burnt. The cinna bread was harder than a hockey puck. The howie rolls were soggy ü§Æ. They forgot the howie bread completely!!",3 weeks ago,Open,1000906628
