Jayson Maurer,1.0,As a covid19 positive individual - just called for delivery and was told they can't drive 7 miles or 11 mins to bring food. Woman was so disgustingly catty and snide on phone it was ridiculous. I will definitely not contribute to this location of Hungry Howies ever again.,3 months ago,Open,1000889894
Audrey Goschke,1.0,"We ordered delivery to a local hotel. Received our food with no napkins or silverware, order included a salad. Not fun to eat with our fingers.
