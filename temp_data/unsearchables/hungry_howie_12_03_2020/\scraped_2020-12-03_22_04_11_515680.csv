Brad Robinson Jr,3.0,"The food has always been good. Hungry Howies works well with the weight watchers program too. They have this one guy that works there that seems like he wasn't meant for customer service. Not a people person, seems to forget about part of your order. May not be the job for him.",3 weeks ago,Open,1000969205

Jeff Svoboda,1.0,This place sucks I ordered a month ago and was great and then I ordered tonight and I think they forgot to put sauce on my pizza.
