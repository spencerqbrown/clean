Karen,4.0,"Food has always been great, staff is friendly, timing has only been a problem during Covid19 lockdown. The littlest problem is the staff needs to slice the pizza better, they forgot my sauce cup (but other places do too), they are timid, probably due to their age, and rude people, which includes those who can‚Äôt spell on here.",3 months ago,Open,1000897818
