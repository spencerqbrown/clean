Anthony Compston,1.0,Ordered a large pepperoni pizza and cheese bread from there last night. That was the worst pizza and cheese bread i have ever had. You can tell they used old expired dough. The pizza was half cooked and cheese bread that is supposed to be thick was thin and tasted like beer.. It totally sucked. Will not order from there again.,a month ago,Open,1000892158

Dee Dee Hake,1.0,We've gotten pizza several times at this location during the covid pandemic. Today was different due to the fact that 3 employees were not wearing masks.
