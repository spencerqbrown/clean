Lionheart Roar,5.0,By far the most courteous and consistent pizza chain in Laredo. They also make great food. Keep up the great work. Your people and your menu is deserving of much more praise.,3 months ago,Open,1000891448
Josie P.,1.0,"I love hungry howie's. It is my favorite pizza place!!! But.....not this one. I had a party and order pizzas, everything was fine until I sent the pizzas on the counter.....after an hour, we started seeing tiny ants in the jalepeno …More",2 months ago,Open,1000891448
GRV,4.0,This place is actually pretty good for a quick bite. There is only 2 tables for dining in. I reccomend this place for take out. The taste of the Pizza is better than the little Cesar's. So if you ran out of time and are in desperate need for something quick and good to satisfy your love ones this is the spot. Enjoy!!,a year ago,Open,1000891448
alicia blake,5.0,"Nice spot for Pizza. Entered near eleven, it wasn't packed. The bill was average for the menu. I can see why they have so many reviews.",2 months ago,Open,1000891448
Daisy R,5.0,A wrong order that came out delicious. Ordered online for a pepperoni pizza but once I got home it was a cheese pizza. Decided to try it and it was great. Not that greasy and wonderful seasonings that makes it the best cheese pizza I've had in a long time. The bread is not soggy nor is the cheese burnt.,10 months ago,Open,1000891448
yusnier gutierrez,1.0,I would never go to this place again. Manager has very poor customer services skills. He was hostile and his workers don’t even know the menu. THANK YOU MANAGER. I WILL NEVER ORDER FOOD FROM YOU GUYS AGAIN GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR RESTAURANT!!!!!!,3 days ago,Open,1000891448

jose esquivel,4.0,"Awesome pizza. Love the crust. Just a tad pricey but well worth it. I have not had any issues with the pizzas from there unlike Little Ceasars.

Peter B,4.0,"Delicious food, lunch specials, good salads for a healthy option. They have subs, wings, stuffed cheese bread, and rolls in addition to pizza. Various flavored crusts are a plus.

Alk paz,5.0,"I've never had a problem with any pizza place in Laredo. Taste is subjective. I've been coming to HH for a little over 10yrs. They have a drive-thru pickup now which is much safer than having to ""go inside"", especially in these days. Thank you HH for still making one heck of a pizza, and actually having that drive-thru window! :D",6 months ago,Open,1000891448
