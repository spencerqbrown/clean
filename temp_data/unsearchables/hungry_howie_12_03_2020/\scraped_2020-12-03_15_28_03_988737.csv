Richard C,4.0,Very clean. The food was exactly what you want from hungry howie's. Fully met expectation. Only thing that prevents a 5 star is the service. Friendly but a little inattentive. Admittedly they were experiencing shift change at the time & it may have resulted in the confusion with paying for my order in a timely manner.,2 months ago,Open,1000902385
