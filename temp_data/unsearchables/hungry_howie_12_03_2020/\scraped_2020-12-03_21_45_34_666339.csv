Linda Johnson,2.0,"We ordered a large works pizza.  The person who helped me on the phone was great,  the delivery driver was very nice and our pizza came in a reasonable amount of time.

Dave Den Adel,5.0,"Their crust is to die for. Seriously, I risked getting into a near miss car accident and suffering heat stroke to get there. Many flavors of crust that all taste the same. Great pizza with zero seating. Well, there is a dilapidated picnic table you can sit at. Make sure your tetanus shot is up to date....üçïüçïüçï",4 months ago,Open,2000037151

Andy Leclair,1.0,Ordered a Steak sub. What I got was a cheese and mushroom blob of S***. Ended up giving it to my dogs so I don't have a nasty picture.

John Bunderson,3.0,"Unique flavored crust pizza. The pricing is reasonable, taste is okay. The company likes to sponsor elementary schools. I appreciate that. The over flavor is okay, just not great.
