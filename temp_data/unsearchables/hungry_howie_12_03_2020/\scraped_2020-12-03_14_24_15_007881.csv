K R,3.0,I love Hungry Howie's pizza. All of the workers here are really nice and attentive. The manager is not very friendly and her stress is very evident. I wish they still gave parmesan cheese with your pizza. Food quality is pretty consistent. ‚Ä¶More,a year ago,Open,1000901182
David Jones,5.0,"Pizza is always good and they have the best bone-in chicken wings out of all the pizza chains in Midland, with Pizza Hut having the next best wings.

vicki R,1.0,Not good. Two employees saw us come in - no greeting - left us standing there several minutes. Another employee finally came to the counter - minimally pleasant.

Deborah Taylor,2.0,"I haven't had Hungry Howie's in years, but I had always remembered it as extremely good pizza. The pizza I got yesterday was lackluster at best.
