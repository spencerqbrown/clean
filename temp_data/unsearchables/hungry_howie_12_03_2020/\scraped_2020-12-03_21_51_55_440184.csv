Robert Talley,4.0,Good pizza. You get exactly what you expect with Hungry Howies. It is quality pizza with a flavored crust. It is good for a quick bite and better than your Kroger pizza of course but not gourmet by any means. It certainly won‚Äôt stop me from ‚Ä¶More,9 months ago,Open,2000147052

Eric Varona-Nava,1.0,Very disappointed in my service this time. I have been a customer since I grew up in Michigan. This location seems to go through periods of good and bad. This time is bad. Can't cut the pizza or the sandwich I ordered. Forget to bring my extra sauce. Then tell me they are out of the stuff after I complained already. Fix it guys,a year ago,Open,2000147052

Krystal Nguy·ªÖn-Harush,4.0,"Ordered a medium cheese pizza with feta, 10 traditional buffalo wings and a small Greek salad. Think they forgot or messed up with the order bc they couldn't find it at first. Waited about more 10 minutes and then drove back to the hotel. Totally chowed down after driving 10+hours.

JML,3.0,"Their ""medium"" pizza was surprisingly small compared to other restaurants. Their pizza tasted ok but not great, and the marinara dipping sauce for their breadsticks tasted like I would expect if it had expired. The garlic bread itself was salty and delicious.",a year ago,Open,2000147052
George Stewart,1.0,while picking up an order I over heard one of the staff say they haven‚Äôt washed their hands all day .? I‚Äôm confused on why anyone would want to eat from here knowing that.
