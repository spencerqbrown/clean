Tokie,1.0,Takes over an hour for a delivery when it takes 15 minutes to make a pizza. I called and said that the pizza would be here in 20 minutes. 40 minutes later pizza is not here. So my pizza has been sitting around for more than an hour. What kind of service is this? I'm currently still waiting for my pizza over an hour later.,a year ago,Open,1000897088

Elizabeth Dixon,5.0,I am absolutely positively 100% satisfied with this store and its employees. Even tho the driver pulled up and parked haphazardly on my grass.
