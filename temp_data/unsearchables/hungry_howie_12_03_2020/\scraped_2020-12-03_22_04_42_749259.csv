Miguel Aquino,5.0,"Easy to place orders online or over the phone.  Prices are cheap, so is the pizza.  Don't expect NY style deliciousness with artisan ingredients here.  They don't pretend to be that.  Now you have a house full of hungry people ready to devour 3 pizzas for $20, this is the spot.  Staff is always very respectful.",2 years ago,Closed,1000969457

Jennntennn,1.0,I would give 0 stars but thatâ€™s not possible. Very fatty fake tasting food. The so called garlic crust is just crust with garlic powder.
