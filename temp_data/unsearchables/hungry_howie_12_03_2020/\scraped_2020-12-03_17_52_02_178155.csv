Austin Tripp,1.0,"Wish I could do 0 stars. Takes more than 2 hours for them to deliver it, if they even show up. And the pizza is pretty gross, but there isn't any other options in town. They have ""refunded"" my order 2 different times after they never showed up but I never got the money back. Stay away from this place, must be bad management.",3 months ago,Open,1000895027

Drunk Pisces,1.0,This place is just wrong.  I enjoy hungry howies but this location has a history of no taking phone orders late in the evening so you are forced to drive there to place your order.
