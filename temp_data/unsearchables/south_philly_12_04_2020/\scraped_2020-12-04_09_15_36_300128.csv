jungle jim,1.0,"The philly steaks were cooked fast, but far from perfection. It was dripping of grease, bread was soggy, the side of fries were soggy, none of it tasted fresh, lacking cheese, the drink served didnt have any ice",4 months ago,Open,1000902807
Juan Rosario,1.0,"I ordered the whiz kid and it was very disappointing. The sandwich was very unsatisfying to eat. The “philly cheese steak” is not authentic and it is very expensive compared to a real Philly cheesesteak. 15$ for a hero, fries, and a soda in which the portion was not justified and the flavor was so uncultured.",4 months ago,Open,1000902807
Kashton Hinton,5.0,This spot is the one I like best. I eat in a lot of restaurants but to this place I go the most. The stuff is very affectionate and the cuisine they place on your table is so flavorful. I never miss an opportunity to have a nice dinner here. Highly recommended.,11 months ago,Open,1000902807

CYBERTZAR,1.0,"The food was pretty decent. But really overpriced, we ordered like 3 philly cheese steaks and 3 drinks for 50 fricking dollars. The employees are bad, have no attitude, and are just so agrivating. I will never dine here again.",a year ago,Open,1000902807
Chipmunk Almond,1.0,"Don't call it as a cheesesteaks from philly. Definitly not even close as phillyscheeseteaks food. I ordered the one called ""The loaded philly"". Come on... putting fries in the sandwich is good idea but your fries taste bad. It just dont …More",2 years ago,Open,1000902807

Lionel,2.0,It was ok.  The food was hot. The meat really under seasoned. A big disappointing really. Large portion though.,4 years ago,Open,1000902807
Jeff Hunk,1.0,"Bread (hoagie) was too soggy from (thawed) vegetables, and the meat can't be really called steak. They use the lowest grade meat with a lot of tendons & ligaments, so it feels like chewing on the shoe sole with fat rather than meat but still overpriced for the quality.",3 years ago,Open,1000902807
Cemal S,1.0,Defiantly not a good cheese steak. Bread was old and meat was uncooked. They put more veggies than the meat itself and this meat not a sirloin steak. I couldn't eat it after first bite.,4 years ago,Open,1000902807
