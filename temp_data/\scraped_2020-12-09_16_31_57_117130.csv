Charly Mendez,5.0,Our family definitely enjoyed the pizza.  The dough was just right and the ingredients had a great fresh taste.  We will definitely order more pizzas from Mountain Mike's Pizza.  We are looking forward to trying other items on the menu too. ‚Ä¶More,3 months ago,Open,2000776152
Jenn Buck,5.0,Great food and great customer service! I was cautious to try due to comments on social media. I'm so glad we gave this place a chance! Our new pizza spot. I got the gluten free crust and it was so delicious! We also did the delivery and the girl was so sweet! Thank you for a great experience.,2 months ago,Open,2000776152
