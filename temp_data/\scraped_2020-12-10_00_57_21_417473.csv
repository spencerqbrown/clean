Bertha Stokes,1.0,"Pizza was a 5, delivery was 1. Vocelli Pizza is good, never had an issue. However, the delivery guy informed me that he would not be coming back because this is not his area! I checked to see where the closet location was and this was it. Next time, I will just pick it up!!",a year ago,Closed,2000060515
silver jinni,1.0,This isn‚Äôt Vocelli anymore! Went to pick up my pizza and found out it‚Äôs now Pizza Walay! I was confused but the new owners told me that Vocelli in Potomac Yard is fraudulently using the closed business location to pick up more customers. ‚Ä¶More,a year ago,Closed,2000060515
Daniel Powers,5.0,Ordering online was easy. Received an email with an estimated delivery time of about an hour (reasonable for the area). Order was delivered within the hour time frame I was told it would be. The delivery person was very friendly. The food is still hot and was very good quality. Would definitely order again.,3 years ago,Closed,2000060515

Jim MacDonald,2.0,"I appreciate that they delivered in a prompt manner, but I did not appreciate the greasy calzone without a sheet of wax paper under it.
