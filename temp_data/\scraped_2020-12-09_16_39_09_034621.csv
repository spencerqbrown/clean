8 3,1.0,Ordered the work pizza. Came with no pepperoni or Canadian bacon at all. The ingredients were just piled in the middle of the pizza too. The driver was more concerned about his tip then remembering my 3 dollar soda. I'll stick with Lou Malnati's from now on.,a year ago,Closed,2000183015

Mary Showalter,1.0,Ordered the new pan pizza with extra cheese .  They sent the wrong crust and then argued with me about it.  If they gave me extra cheese it must have been tossed on someone else's pizza.  Totally sucked .  Will never order from them again.,4 years ago,Closed,2000183015
