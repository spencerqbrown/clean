Dale Randall,1.0,I love pizza hut but the pizza we got tonight was terrible. I usually rate them better than Casey's pizza. No flavor they didn't butter the crust and forgot my garlic sauce.,a week ago,Open,1000818258
Jim Crabb,2.0,"Update, not sure what Pizza hut has done to their pizza, but it no longer agrees with me, to the point I couldnt finish the last two slices. At a loss as to what to point too. To bad, overall I like Pizza Hut. ‚Ä¶More",a year ago,Open,1000818258
Casey Luke,1.0,Got the notification that my food was on the way. I went and waited by the front door for a half hour (they are 6 blocks away). No one showed. I called to cancel because I don't want old or cold food. They claim no one answered the door ‚Ä¶More,a month ago,Open,1000818258

Destini Scrivener,2.0,"The food is just... okay. As someone who really likes Pizza Hut it's kind of disappointing how mediocre the food is. The pizza crust is always very thick, toppings are sparse and the cheese lacks much flavor. However, the wings are pretty good.

Devon Henriksen,2.0,"Ordered some stuffed crust from here, the stuffed crust part was the only good thing about the pizza, there was little to no sauce at all, I could literally see through my pizza crust because there was barely any cheese and sauce, I didn't even ask for thin crust.
