Dennis Devero,4.0,"This is really good pizza, I drive a long way to get, but it's always worth it. Milledgeville doesn't have a Pizza Hut anymore, but I think this one had them beat. It's really good and I think if you like pizza it's worth the trip. Curbside service is available in this day and time.",3 months ago,Open,1000818096

David Long,2.0,"Pizza was not done. It was only warm when I picked it up. It was cold before I could finish the first piece. They get 2 stars by virtue of selling the pizza for almost half price, however, is it worth it if you have to cook the pizza once you get it home?",a year ago,Open,1000818096
