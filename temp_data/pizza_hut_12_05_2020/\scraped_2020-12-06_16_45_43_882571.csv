Cmeron F.,1.0,"Better off to drive to minden or ruston for better pizza. Sad because pizza hut used to be really good and have great pizza. Now it's nothing like it used to be. The dine-in experience is a complete joke as well here. Yum! Brands, Inc. who owns it needs to make some serious changes otherwise they'll be going out of business.",4 months ago,Open,1000820391
Wade Verret,1.0,"Wow.. Spent 20 bucks for wings and teeny pizza, and they will not give me a cup of water while dining in..  they'll sell a water, but they actually won't give you any. Screw you pizza hut, you just lost a customer.",3 years ago,Open,1000820391

Sylvia Brown,2.0,"Pizza was good, but no fountain sodas hot 20oz sodas. Have to get up get your own plates forks n napkins. No salad or salad bar. Not a good place to eat at maybe good for carry out.",a year ago,Open,1000820391
Felecia White,1.0,"Rude workers ..only one showed concern. This location does NOT sell fountain drinks so you will have to buy their high-priced 20 oz or 2 liter. Area was not clean even though nobody was in the restaurant eating. If you want a place for your family to sit down and enjoy a meal with family fun, this is DEFINITELY NOT the place.",a year ago,Open,1000820391
