D O Double G,4.0,"I placed an order online prior to the store opening for pickup later that day. As a result the order didn't go through & wasn't ready when I went to pick it up. However, they were extremely apologetic & refunded the cost of the pizza. That's good customer service. üëçüëç",3 weeks ago,Open,1000816245

Monica Blommer,1.0,How about when a car is parked directly in front of the restaurant in plain sight who is online for ordering a pizza (gave description of car)   that you ask what they ordered. I specified a contactless order thru my passenger window.   The person parked behind me was served so they had to see that I was there.,a month ago,Open,1000816245
