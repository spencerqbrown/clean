Harrison C. Davies,4.0,What I like about this Pizza Hut location is that it is exactly what it needs to be for the area. It is a dine in location perfect for travelers to grab a quick bite and the atmosphere is settling. Take out with the app tends to be a better deal so definitely keep that in mind. #pizzahut #stuffedcrust,a year ago,Open,1000817842
