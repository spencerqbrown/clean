Chris McNabb,1.0,This particular Pizza hut is very stingy with the pizza toppings.  A large pizza slice should have more than 2 pieces of pepperoni on it.  No big deal if this just happened once.   Unfortunately it has happened twice at this location.,3 years ago,Open,1000818897

Adam Murphy,1.0,"I understand what they are trying to accomplish with having the lobby closed, but as a previous review stated - the staff are completely lost. Waited outside for an extremely long time (after calling to inform I had arrived). Ended up leaving and going elsewhere for food. Definitely would not recommend this particular location!",21 hours ago,Open,1000818897
