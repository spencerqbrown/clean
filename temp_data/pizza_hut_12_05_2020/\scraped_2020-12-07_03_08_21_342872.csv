Lisa Gibson,5.0,We ordered four large stuffed crust pizzas and all four had little to no sauce in the center to about 2/3 of the way up. It did have sauce near the crust. Sauce is what makes the pizza. It was basically cheese bread. Very dry. I am adding a picture where I peeled the toppings back at the bottom right.,11 months ago,Open,1000819554
