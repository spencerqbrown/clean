Tyler Olsen,1.0,Just received my order. Burnt and missing pasta and marinara dipping sauce. Tried calling and no one answered. What a rip off.,10 months ago,Closed,2000464802
Chelsey Lipka,1.0,"Since the new owners took over, it's been going down hill. I've had bad experiences every time. Most pizzas are never cooked all the way and usually doughy or soggy in the middle. Plus, none of the sales or deals are ever applicable in my area so it's the most expensive pizza in town.",10 months ago,Closed,2000464802
Rissie Olsen,1.0,"Ordered two dinner boxes. Pasta was missing from one box. The pizzas look AWFUL, burnt and cold. Also missing the marinara sauce for the breadsticks. Tried calling in to give them a chance to make it right and our calls were ignored for 20 minutes. Very disappointing and $80 down the drain (that $10 tip was not earned).",10 months ago,Closed,2000464802
