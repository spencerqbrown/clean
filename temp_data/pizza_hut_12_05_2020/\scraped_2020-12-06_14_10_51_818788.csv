Cassie L,1.0,"They NEVER get your order right. We stopped ordering there for over a year and decided to try them again. BOOM, order wrong again. Pay attention to what's on the ticket. Kind of pointless to offer delivery when you can't even get someone's order correct. Will not order from here again.",a month ago,Open,1000819697

Anna Courtney,4.0,We went for the $6.99 pizza buffet. It was very busy in there but the staff we're more than efficient and one girl in particular was very friendly. The pizza was hot and fresh but the ziti and breadsticks were only okay. There was also a small salad buffet. It was actually quite good for the price.,a year ago,Open,1000819697
casey robinson,1.0,The salad was rotten. 1 server. Bunch of kids hangout and employees not professional at all. Employees standing around with their arms crossed . No one pays attention to give refills for drinks. A DAMN shame. Salad in the salad bar was not dumped the entire time I was there. Won't be back!!!!,a year ago,Open,1000819697
Jeffrey Adams,5.0,This place is great. Always good and fresh here. If you stop in you won't be disappointed. Only thing is I love the salad bar but it's never stocked very well here like the other ones I've been to but the pizza is top notch. Everytime I'm in town I make it a point to eat here.
