Ernesto G. Aguilar,5.0,The best pizza hut pizza I've had in a while. I live in Ventura and I usually don't go to the pizza hut there because it's not that good. I work here in Newbury and I wasn't expecting much to be completely honest. However when I opened the box I was completely surprised. The pizza looked fluffy and was really good.,2 months ago,Open,1000815749

Lorenzo Gonzalez,5.0,"Fast, convenient, and sinfully delicious. Sure, the sausage ""crumbles"" look suspiciously similar to milk-soaked dry cat food (as pointed out by my vegetarian and therefore totally biased wife). But do I care? Nope. Taste great to me.

Tavi Scratch,4.0,"Pretty nice establishment, I like the interior design and the food was prepared in a quick Manor. If I had any issues it would be the noise the door made when I stood near it, but it's easily avoided if you don't stand so close to it so I didn't have too much of an issue there.
