Mike Glover,1.0,"I couldn‚Äôt take a picture of the frigid temperature of the breadstick sauce. We haven‚Äôt had Pizza Hut in some time but I can assure that based on this experience, it will be the last. So disappointed in our meal tonight. Want to love it but just can‚Äôt any longer.  Throwing out nearly $50 in food tonight. Shame on this Pizza Hut location.",2 weeks ago,Open,1000819329
Cindy Gosman,1.0,"We just got a large 3 topping pizza, not very good, waited 45 minutes....they were busy so understand ... however our crust tasted like it was from yesterday, and even though I was handed the pizza just after it was cut.

Brenten Brooks,1.0,"This is supposed to be a stuff crust pizza. Apparantly no cheese is being used. It's all liquid, but cold. It's the consistancy of grits. There is absolutely no cheese in my stuffed crust. This is the sorriest excuse of a pizza I have ever ‚Ä¶More",2 years ago,Open,1000819329

Brian Gamble,1.0,If medium one topping pizzas are 5 dollars and I order 3 and add 1 topping to two of them how does that cost 26 dollars employees don't do math I guess because they couldn't help me to understand it 3x5=15+2 toppings  at 1.50=3. So ‚Ä¶More,a year ago,Open,1000819329
