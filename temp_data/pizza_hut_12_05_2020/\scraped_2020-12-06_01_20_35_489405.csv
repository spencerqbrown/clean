Trent Wilbanks,5.0,The last couple of times I have ordered Pizza it has been amazing: perfectly cooked and lots of toppings. I ordered extra toppings and wow! They don‚Äôt skimp on extras anymore. Staff was polite and professional. They have improved 100% in the last few months.,a year ago,Open,1000817977
Charlotte Robb,1.0,Never greeted by anyone when we went in. Tables were sticky. Pizza on pizza bar was soggy. Had to use a fork to eat it. It had good flavor but not pizza huts best. Will not eat at this one again.,a year ago,Open,1000817977

Marti Van Neste,3.0,This would be a better review except for the fact that they won't deliver to our address in spite of our address being in city limits. The other Pizza place is further away but will deliver to us. Sometimes Pizza Hut doesn't even have a driver available. Don't advertise delivery options if you won't deliver.,a year ago,Open,1000817977
katie burks,1.0,Food is fine but the drama with employees friends isnt worth wasting your lunch hour on the buffet. You should be able to get lunch without comments being made about you to employees loud enough to hear. I work as a licensed Insurance agent in town.,2 years ago,Open,1000817977

Jenatta Jones,2.0,"This experience ruined my taste for Pizza Hut which has been a long time family treat. The P'Zone I ordered was actually dry and over cooked.
