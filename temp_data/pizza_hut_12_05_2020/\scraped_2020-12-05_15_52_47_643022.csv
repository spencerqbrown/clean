Nathan Byrum,5.0,"This is a wonderful little location.  Just don't expect to dine in, as there are only 2 or 3 booths in a small lobby;  Think less dining room and more waiting area for carry-out orders.  I actually live within a block of this Pizza hut, and use it often.  I've always been well satisfied;  In fact, I think I'm about to go snag a pie now!",2 years ago,Closed,1000810379

Jason Pierce,4.0,It's a small town Pizza Hut in Ashland Missouri that does their Pizza really differently then Pizza Huts I've been to and I actually love it. It tastes like its done differently but it isn't. It's some of the best Pizza I've eaten. Also the Staff are really communicative and open and it's a relaxing atmosphere to be in.

Amber Tinsley,3.0,"Not your typical Pizza Hut. Seriously. They have dine in, but you order at the counter, have a seat, and they bring your pizza out in a box and either you eat out of the box or on paper towels. Which isn't a big deal but like I said not â€¦More",3 years ago,Closed,1000810379
