Tah'i H,2.0,"Alfredo is always overcooked and pasta is crunchy, very little to almost no sauce. Always a long wait time even when no customers. Staff is always friendly but could do a better job.",8 months ago,Open,2000791184
Daniel Barajas,1.0,"Food was 30 minutes late and over cooked, my pizza was way too crunchy, the cheese was so over cooked it had no flavor. Do not recommend this place at all.",2 years ago,Open,2000791184

Christian Vasquez,1.0,The employees couldn't find the street after address checking for it. Domino's delivers to the same place just fine. Upsetting because I love Pizza hut but the employees can't address check or use Google maps correctly,a year ago,Open,2000791184
Misha Slavin,5.0,Surprisingly fast to order from here on a Friday night (like 15 minutes) and everything was cooked exactly how I expected it to be. Giving 5 stars because it was probably the easiest fastest Pizza hut experience I've had.,a year ago,Open,2000791184

Jay C,1.0,Absolutely  horrible.  The worst pizza I've ever had. This is a pizza  hut thing.  Not a location thing. Facility was clean and the staff were very professional and offered  great customer service.  Pizza hut is garbage.  Never again ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®,2 years ago,Open,2000791184

William Abner,1.0,This place went from the best Pizza Hut a few years ago to the worst place for pizza anywhere.  The more toppings you order the less they put on your order. Taste is horrible. I've even put in an formal complaint.,2 years ago,Open,2000791184
