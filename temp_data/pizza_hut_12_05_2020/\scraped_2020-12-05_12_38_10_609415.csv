R B,1.0,"Pizza hut SELLS their customer information. Don't believe me? You can find it on their website. They don't even tell you up front! You have to opt out after the fact!

dalton qualls,2.0,"I live less then 2 minutes away so I figured a delivery would be swift and easy, but boy was I wrong. It took around an hour to get my pizza when the estimated time was 25-30 minutes. When i got my pizza it was cold, and wasnt made correctly either. If i do order from here again, I'll be picking it up myself.",9 months ago,Closed,1000805689

Holly C,2.0,"Review of delivery only. Placed around 10 or so over the last year and almost all of them had something wrong with my order.
