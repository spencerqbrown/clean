Angla Adorno,4.0,"We stopped here for lunch on the way back from our trip. We had a group of 10 (4 adults, 6 teenagers 13-16). We waited about 30 mins, which for a group that size is OK. The pizza was very good I thought and the teenagers loved it. The staff that we had was great and very friendly. Can definitely recommend this place.",a year ago,Open,1000818770
Shannon G.,1.0,$4 for delivery regardless of order size is insanity. Especially when the location is less than a 10 minute drive. I can get food 20 mins from me for .99 delivery fee. Not ordering from here until they lower this ridiculous fee.,a year ago,Open,1000818770

George Barry,1.0,"Bad experience again. Ordered an ultimate stuffed cheese. Came to pick up only to be told it's a seasonal item that's no longer available, even though they charged me for it. Was charged 22 bucks. Offered 10 buck credit for next time I order. No receipt or credit slip. Feel robbed and mediocre pizza. Don't use this place. Badly run.",2 years ago,Open,1000818770
