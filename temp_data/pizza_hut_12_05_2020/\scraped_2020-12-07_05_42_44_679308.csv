Teresa Kyer,4.0,Pizza is usually very greasy. Service is fast. Employees usually don‚Äôt understand what you want so it‚Äôs better to order on the app if you want your order correct. Not sure why the pizza is always so greasy here while other locations are not. Overall I do order here for the convenience and the kids still love it.,7 months ago,Open,1000821900
