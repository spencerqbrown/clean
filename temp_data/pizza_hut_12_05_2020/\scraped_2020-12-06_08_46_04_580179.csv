Stephanie Arndt,4.0,"It's Pizza Hut. I was unsure if there was seating available until we came... There are about 6-8 chairs and two small tables. It's really just for walk in and take out pizza.

andria limburg,5.0,I just moved to Hartford and decided to order a quick easy dinner. Due to the heavy snow and bitter cold I expected my food to be late and probably cold.
