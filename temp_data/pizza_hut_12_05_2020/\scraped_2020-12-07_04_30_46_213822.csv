Kris Parker,1.0,I ordered pizza online at 6:30 and it won't be delivered until 11:46 pm ..So I call the store only to be on hold for 32 minutes and counting. No one is answering the phone .. I am beyond disgusted with this place. Last time they delivered cold pizza. I will NEVER order from Pizza Hut again,5 years ago,Open,1000819788
