Shawn Eubanks,1.0,"A restaurant should never get this bad. There is what looks like 3 employees attending to the whole store. None of the tables are clean and I've seen patrons have to move dishes just to sit down and eat. An employee even came to check on who was here, take the tips off the tables, and not bus them.",11 months ago,Open,1000812821

Christine Bean,1.0,While paying for my order I watched the man preparing the pizzas. While scratching his face and arm he kept using his hands to put cheese and pepperoni on the pizza with no gloves on. Also had a long beard and hair with no nets covering.
