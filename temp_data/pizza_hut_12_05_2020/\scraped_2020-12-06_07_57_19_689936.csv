Michael Myers,1.0,"Dear owner operator manager. Your store was our choice tonight, and I will not make that mistake again. Food is cold and your manager Becky is beyond rude. We ordered 80.00 in pizza and wings and got no sauces. I questioned your manager and got a rude belligerent woman. I will now be going to Columbus from here on out. Thank you.",a year ago,Open,1000818053
Bob Thomas,3.0,Nice place but the tables needed to be wiped off and salt and pepper shakers needs to be wiped off to. Very sticky and the top fell off the red pepper shaker and everything thing fell out on my pizza. And it was around 3:30 pm. No one else in there so I think they could have been cleaning up for the supper time.,a year ago,Open,1000818053
