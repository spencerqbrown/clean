Tru Dhillon,1.0,This Pizzahut has reminded me why I do not order Pizzahut... I waited close to an hour for my initial order of pasta and bread sticks. Well.. I never got the bread sticks or a fork for my pasta and I am in a hotel room with no silverware. …More,a year ago,Closed,1000815246

Brandon Sichting,3.0,Pizza was as usual. Good service. I can only assume that the bread sticks are pre-made and set for a few hours before they sale them because they were rock hard and could not eat them. Overall not a horrible Pizza Hut.,3 years ago,Closed,1000815246
JR Curley,3.0,"This is a very small Pizza Hut, made primarily for pick-up and delivery. The location is a bit run down, and is at the north end of a small restaurant cluster, making parking challenging at times. Delivery speeds are good, and pick up is smooth. Staff are friendly, jovial and active.",4 years ago,Closed,1000815246
