Bridgette Edmondson,2.0,Pizza Hut has really gone down. We ordered a large pizza at this location for take out. Our pizza was almost burnt. Picking it up and eating it would make one think they were eating a card board box. Limited sauce. Limited cheese. Limited meats. Everything was bare minimal and burnt.,6 months ago,Closed,1000814848

Chance White,4.0,"Pizza Hut's quality took a serious nose dive for a long time, but now their pan pizza is arguably the best in the business.  The sauce is perfect, just enough cheese, and the crust has a great texture and flavor.
