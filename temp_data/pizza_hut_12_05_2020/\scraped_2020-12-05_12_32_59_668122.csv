Che W,1.0,This is the worst pizza hut EVER. They never have drivers to deliver and will only tell you this after they have taken your credit card number and charged your card. If they do have drivers the pizza is underdone. The worst customer service I have ever had. Do not order from this location.,11 months ago,Closed,1000805750
