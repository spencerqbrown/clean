SJ,1.0,"I tried calling 3 times during business hours (approx from 5:30 - 6pm) and nobody picked up. No voicemail, nothing. Let it ring over a dozen times on the second to last call. Cannot call yourself a business if it doesn't act like one.",a year ago,Open,1000813455
Tracy Arevalo,1.0,I called and the phone ran for minutes. You should answer a call within 3 seconds I thought...this is sales?!? It was a younger voice that answered.
