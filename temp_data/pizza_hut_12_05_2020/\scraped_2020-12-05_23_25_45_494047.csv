KSStorm Info,2.0,"Ordered BBQ beef pizza. Got ground beef on BBQ sauce. Totally not what I was looking for. One of the few Pizza Huts still in the original mansard roof buildings... I was hoping for a bit of nostalgia, but this one looks like it's last interior remodel was in the early 90s. Don't think I'll be going back to this location.",a year ago,Closed,1000817307
