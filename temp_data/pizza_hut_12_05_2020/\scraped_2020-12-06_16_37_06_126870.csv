Brittney Collins,4.0,The food was great but the curbside pickup service wasn't on point. They told us our food wasn't ready but when it is they'd bring it out so we waited for about 20 minutes until we decided to go in and it was just sitting there on the counter and nobody said anything. Other than that it's usually good service.,a month ago,Open,1000820095
