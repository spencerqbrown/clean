Kaitlyn Nicole,3.0,"I mean, the food is okay. But when I sit in a booth I would prefer them to be clean. I glanced down the side of the booth and itâ€™s a complete mess! Pieces of ceiling, dipping cups, food, etc. gross! Holes in the tiles, tables are sticky, ceiling is disgusting. I donâ€™t trust eating food from here anymore.",a year ago,Closed,1000813375

Leola Travis,3.0,Not the best place to get pizza in town. It's ok but not great. Hut rewards are nice but improvements on this store could definitely be made. We've not dined in in a while to speak on the atmosphere but the staff has always been friendly over the phone and through delivery. They often don't have a delivery driver when we order.,a year ago,Closed,1000813375
Adam Melton,1.0,I place an order online for delivery like i have several times. i get a call from the pizza hut and they say they are not doing delivery tonight.... so you offer delivery and you dont deliver. place needs a management check.,a year ago,Closed,1000813375
