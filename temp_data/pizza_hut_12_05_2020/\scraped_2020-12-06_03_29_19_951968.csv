Tammy Stanley,1.0,Everytime I have tried this location it's never cooked correctly as ordered. It either not as ordered or not cooked fully or over cooked to almost burnt if you asked them to cook it a liitle bit more. Then when you bring it thier attention they argue and dont want to fix the problem. I would have gave them 0 stars if that was an option.,a month ago,Open,1000817487
