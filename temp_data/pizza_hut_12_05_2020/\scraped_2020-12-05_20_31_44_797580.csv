Traci Bierhaus,5.0,Nicole made our dining experience a very enjoyable late supper! There's hardly anything but McDonald's open at 10pm on Friday night in Beardstown. But Nicole welcomed us during a horrible snow storm. The food was as good as her service! I can see why she was recently promoted to a managerial position! Thanks again Nicole! Great job!,a year ago,Open,1000814834
