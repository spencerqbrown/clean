WCburnsie,1.0,"I'm having to update my review, even before the epidemic happened. Absolutely do NOT buy stuffed crust, you will be left with an absolute terrible excuse of a pizza with barely any sauce and a pizza that can't even hold itself when you pick up a slice. This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever known.",4 months ago,Open,1000821119
cara branning,1.0,The service is absolutely atrocious. The food took forever and a day to hit the table. When it arrived the appetizers were cold. The pizza was doughy and fell apart when the slice was lifted. You pay $2+ for a drink and have to beg for a refill.
