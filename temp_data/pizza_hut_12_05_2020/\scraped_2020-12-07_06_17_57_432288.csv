Lolly Goose,4.0,"First time having Pizza Hut in about 4 yrs maybe longer? It was pretty good. I had the dinner box, only major complaint was the ""end pieces"" didn't have any sauce. I used to LOVE the sauce, last time I got The Hut it was sour and gross. ‚Ä¶More",a month ago,Open,2000424724
Mazen Elkhatib,4.0,The pizzas were cooked to perfection and it was a prompt delivery.  We ordered a medium pizza which was as expected and a personal pizza but it was tiny.
