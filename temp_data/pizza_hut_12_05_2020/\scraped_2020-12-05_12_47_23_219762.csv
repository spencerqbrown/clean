shane pulliam,5.0,"Went here the night before Thanksgiving. There was no waiting, seated immediately, and had the whole place to ourselves. What a great change of pace from all the crowds. Their pan pizza is always good and elicits memories of going to a pizza hut growing up. Here's to making new memories with my family. Thanks Pizza Hut",3 years ago,Closed,1000805894
