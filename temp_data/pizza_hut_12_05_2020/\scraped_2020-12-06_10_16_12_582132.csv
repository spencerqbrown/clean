HH Town,1.0,The most cold and disgusting pizza I've ever had in my life. You would think after waiting 2 hours it would be hot and fresh. I called 4 times. No answer. The crust is hard as a rock and they doused it in garlic sauce and season. 2 pizzas and breadsticks went into the trash.,a week ago,Open,1000818891
