Alexis Scott,5.0,"Service was amazing (Angie is the best). Food was so good. We ordered a speciality pizza and it came out wrong and the waitress was able to quickly get us a new one, took it off our bill and gave us a free pizza!

Tony Perry,2.0,The pizza is ok (three stars) but inconsistent.  The facility needs to be bulldozed and rebuilt.  The inside is in poor shape.  It needs thoroughly cleaned.
