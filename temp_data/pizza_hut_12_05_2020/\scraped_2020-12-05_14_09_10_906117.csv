E Carmon,4.0,The manager is nice and very assertive. He works along with his employees. I just think they need to be trained on how to make a pizza look and taste more cheesy. My cheese costs more and I think it should be considered like every other topping in the discounts.,2 weeks ago,Open,1000808365
