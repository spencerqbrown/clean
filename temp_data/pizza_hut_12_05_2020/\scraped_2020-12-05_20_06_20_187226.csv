Yung Gnar,1.0,Staff isnâ€™t good. We ordered our pizza and then got put on hold. A lady answered the phone and re took our order. When we asked her what was going on she completely ignored our question. The pizza was very bad and dry. I would go elsewhere. Itâ€™s not Pizza Hut thatâ€™s not good itâ€™s the people that run this location.,a year ago,Closed,1000815078

Nina Bowman,1.0,Ordered from a few times.. this time the delivery guy shorted me change.  When I called about my $15 the guy had lied and said I gave him a $20 tip. Why would anyone do that for a $28.00 order? Complete scumbag. We will never order from â€¦More,4 years ago,Closed,1000815078
