Didier Chesneau,3.0,I think when you order a 2 topping pizza you want to have healthy portions of both toppings on each slice of pizza. This was not the case of my pizza. It was still good and enjoyed but no need to skimp on a topping like onions which are so cheap and should be spread plentifully.,a month ago,Open,1000818450

Eugene McCown,1.0,"Purchased as 3 topping pizza and I didnâ€™t think that it would be only three pieces of the toppings per slice. ðŸ˜‚.
