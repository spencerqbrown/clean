Marla Canady,1.0,"This has always been my preference of pizza to order. This recent order was absolutely a mess. Ordered the standard hamburger pizza, sausage pizza, and pepperoni pizza. None were cheesy and the meat was overcooked. Very disappointed considering how I have always liked pizza hut.",5 days ago,Open,1000817817
Joshua McClain,1.0,"Do not order from here! They are terrible. I ordered delivery and I received this pizza! I was told I had to bring the pizza back to the restaurant for a refund because I paid in cash, mind you the driver just left my house a quick call â€¦More",2 years ago,Open,1000817817
marlin harriel,1.0,I order a stuff crust supreme and it did have hardly any toppings on it and they gave me thin crust and I didn't ask for thin crust I call my order in and still had to wait when I got there at the time they said it would be ready and I stay 7 minutes or less away and my pizza was cold a total disappointment,2 months ago,Open,1000817817

My Privacy,2.0,"My first order, they cut the pizza slices very uneven. Try splitting a pizza that is cut like that.

CHRIS SIMPSON,4.0,"Disappointed.  Ordered original pan meat lovers with extra cheese and hut favorite crust -. Pizza was just coming out of oven when I picked it up, drove 3 minutes home, it was barely warm, cheese wasn't as melted as usual and no crust flavoring.  Never had this problem at West Main location, my usual, lesson learned!!",a year ago,Open,1000817817
Lauren Greenlee,1.0,"I will never order from this Pizza hut again, not only do they have very rude delivery drivers but they messed my order up .
