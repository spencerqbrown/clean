David Garland,2.0,"It's good pizza overall, but we haven't once had our order correct. Sometimes is the crust not being seasoned. Others it's not cut completely. The garlic knot pizza we got had a total of 10 knots on the whole thing. It makes me sad because their pizza tastes really good when its properly.",11 months ago,Closed,1000806735
