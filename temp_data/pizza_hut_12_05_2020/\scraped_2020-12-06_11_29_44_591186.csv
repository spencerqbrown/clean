2nd Draft Music,4.0,"Great food, great service! But the pizza buffet is terrible. They have only 2 pizzas per hour (and they have to be shared by everyone there) and they have like pineapple sausage or something.

Andy Maag,4.0,"It's really great that they have a drive through window for pick up, and really unfortunate that they don't prioritize it.

douglas clements,1.0,"I normally like Pizza Hut, but after two times at the one in Waterloo IL, not again.
