shawna mesa,1.0,We ordered the buffet. Can I just say everything on the buffet tasted salty even the cinnamon sticks. We were questioning if this was a real Pizza Hut or if someone just the building and never took the sign down. WORST pizza I have ever had from a restaurant. A frozen Tontinos pizza has more flavor.,8 months ago,Open,1000819491

Donella Hundley,3.0,Our food was good! No issues with that side of things. However.. the service or lack there of was another story. The complete indifference of the kid who half-assed waited on us was simply rude.
