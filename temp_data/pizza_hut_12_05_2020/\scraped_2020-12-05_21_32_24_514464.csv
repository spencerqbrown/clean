Freya Fyrsdattir,1.0,Burnt cinnabon rolls and hand-tossed pizza was super thin. Overflow call center wasn't helpful. I wasn't able to contact the store directly either. Horrible customer service!,11 months ago,Closed,1000816417
helen anne h,1.0,Mom called and ordered a special. Waited two hours no pizza. My mother called them and was put on hold for 1 hour. We went to the location and they told us that it was on our doorstep. IT WASNT. So we decided to go to papa johns. Kinda glad because papa johns is ten times better. Oh!
